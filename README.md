# PaloAlto-PeriodicCLI

Inspired by the knowledgebase article [How to collect the output of CLI commands periodically using Tera Term script](https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000bo8eCAA&lang=en_US%E2%80%A9) from Palo Alto, I created a more flexible solution to run any commands periodically

Tested with Terra Term 4.106
